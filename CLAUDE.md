# linkendin-resume — Claude context

> **Claude Code**: also read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for code specifications.

## What does this project do?

Persuasive online CV / personal resume website. Dark-themed, one-page, animated React app that stands out visually from traditional static PDF-style CVs. Contact is handled by redirecting visitors to GitHub Issues (no backend email form). Live at **resume.chrysa.dev**.

## Development workflow

```bash
make dev           # docker-compose dev
make build         # production build
make pre-commit    # run pre-commit checks

# Inside app/
npm run dev        # Vite dev server
npm run build      # Vite production build
npm run test       # Vitest
npm run lint       # ESLint
```

## Key conventions

- Resume content lives entirely in `app/cv.json` — all text/data changes go here, not in components
- Contact section: links to GitHub Issues, not a form (no backend required)
- Animations: Framer Motion `motion.*` components, enter/exit transitions on scroll
- Dark theme: CSS custom properties, no theming library
- GitHub Issues templates: `bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml` in `.github/`

## Environment variables

- `VITE_BASE_URL` — base URL for meta tags and sitemap (default: `https://resume.chrysa.dev`)
- `VITE_GITHUB_ISSUES_URL` — link to GitHub Issues for the contact section

## Notes / known issues

- SonarCloud configured: project key `chrysa_linkendin-resume`, coverage badge active
- `cv.json` schema is informal — no JSON Schema validation yet
- Framer Motion 12 requires React 18+ — confirm compatibility with React 19
- `context.md` contains editorial notes on tone and positioning
- Live URL: https://resume.chrysa.dev

## Skills

Shared skills from `shared-standards/.claude/skills/`:

- `ui-ux/SKILL.md` — UX/UI/ergonomics across ALL surfaces (web, CLI, VS Code, Discord, desktop, game, agent) + WCAG 2.1 AA + dark mode + i18n FR+EN (load when building any human-facing surface)

These conventions are identical across every chrysa repo. Repo-specific rules live in the
local `CLAUDE.md`; this file is the shared baseline imported by it.

## Non-negotiable conventions

- **Language**: English — all code, comments, docs, instructions, and config files.
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`).
- **Branches**: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/`, `release/` · default branch `develop`.
- **Merge**: squash merge only · force push forbidden · auto-merge requires CI + owner.
- **One PR per issue**, scoped tight. Every PR references an issue (`Closes/Fixes/Refs #N`).
  Exception: label `hotfix`. The `enforce-issue-link` workflow is a blocking status check.
- **Tests: pytest only** — assert-style test functions and `pytest-mock` (`mocker`
  fixture: `mocker.patch`, `mocker.AsyncMock`) for all mocking. The stdlib **`unittest`
  framework (`unittest.TestCase`) and `unittest.mock` imports are forbidden** — no
  `import unittest`, no `from unittest.mock import …`. See the `testing-pytest` skill.
- **Dark mode** mandatory from V1. **Accessibility** WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **UI state survives reload & focus** — human-facing surfaces persist their navigation
  and view state (active tab/section, selected sub-view, active context/filters) so a
  **manual reload keeps the current page** — the user lands exactly where they were, never
  reset to a default. Persist to `localStorage` (or the URL for shareable state), guarded
  by a validator that discards stale/removed values. Interface or state changes must
  **propagate across the app's own tabs/windows and on refocus/reload**: listen to the
  browser `storage` event and re-read on `window` `focus`, so a view opened while hidden
  never shows stale state after the user comes back. A reload that loses the user's place,
  or a change that fails to propagate on focus/reload, is a bug.
- **Notion logging**: every advancement and modification (progress, decisions, state
  changes) is logged in Notion — the single source of truth. Run `@notion-sync` after any
  state change; in case of conflict between local docs and Notion, Notion wins.
- **No hardcoded constants** in code — neither backend (Python) nor frontend (TS).
  All constants and config values (thresholds, business rules, labels, URLs, magic
  numbers) live in **external YAML files** and are loaded at runtime. Code reads them
  through a typed loader (Pydantic Settings backend · generated typed module frontend),
  never as inline literals. Only language-level enums (e.g. `status.HTTP_*`) are exempt.
- **Semantic URLs & code** — URLs are resource-oriented and human-readable: lowercase,
  hyphenated, plural-noun collections, no verbs or actions in the path (`GET /invoices/42`,
  never `/getInvoice?id=42`); REST shapes follow the `api-design` skill. Code is
  self-describing: intention-revealing names over comments, semantic HTML elements
  (`<nav>`, `<button>`, `<main>`, `<header>`…) never a `<div>` wired as a control, and
  ARIA used only to fill gaps native semantics cannot express.

## Quality gates

- Test coverage **>= 85%** by default. A repo may override upward, never below 80%.
- Lint warnings: **0**. Mypy clean. SonarCloud rating **A**, 0 security hotspot.
- Max function lines 50 · max file lines 500 · cyclomatic complexity heuristic <= 10.

## Makefile targets

- **Referential**: `Forge-Stack-Workshop/base-makefile` (`Makefile.basic`, `Makefile.python`,
  `Makefile.with-sub-folder`) is the single source of truth for target names and behaviour.
- **Canonical naming** — follow base-makefile verbatim, one word where it is one word:
  `typecheck` (**never** `type-check`), `test-cov`, `format-check`, `quality-gate-verify`,
  `docker-test`, `ci`. Renaming or aliasing a canonical target is forbidden.
- **Mandatory socle** — every application repo MUST expose, with these exact names and intent:
  `help install install-dev lint format format-check typecheck test test-cov pre-commit clean
  ci quality-gate-baseline quality-gate-verify`. Non-applicative repos (pure infra/Helm/Terraform,
  config-only, docs) are exempt from the language-specific targets (`typecheck`, `test-cov`) but
  still expose `help lint pre-commit clean`.
- **Docs must match** — every `make <target>` cited in `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` MUST exist in
  the Makefile (no `make type-check` when the target is `typecheck`).
- **Recipe style** — prefix every recipe line with `@`; add `## Description` after each target so
  it appears in `make help`.

## Shared skills (load on demand from shared-standards/.claude/skills/)

- `testing-pytest` — pytest DDD + pytest-mock + constants (writing tests)
- `dockerfile-multistage` — 4-stage Python 3.14 containers (editing Dockerfile)
- `api-design` — REST standards + FastAPI patterns (designing endpoints)
- `async-patterns` — async FastAPI + SQLAlchemy async sessions (async code)
- `clean-architecture` — FastAPI module/layer structure (adding a feature)
- `error-handling` — FastAPI errors + Sentry + logging (handling errors)
- `contract-testing` — library contract / breaking-change tests (@chrysa/* releases)
- `agent-patterns` — LangGraph + PydanticAI + Claude API (building agents)

## Error handling pattern (all automations)

```text
try:    fn()
except: gh issue create --title "[chrysa] failure" --label "chrysa-error"
```

## Observability — Sentry → GitHub issues (norm)

Every status:dev repo ships a Sentry project, and **a new Sentry issue automatically opens a
GitHub issue** via Sentry's native GitHub integration. No relay, no PAT in the repo — the
integration owns the link, so a Sentry issue maps to exactly one GitHub issue (no duplicates).

Mechanism: a per-project Sentry **issue alert rule** with
condition `FirstSeenEventCondition` (a new issue is created) and action
`GitHubCreateTicketAction` targeting `chrysa/<repo>`, labels `sentry`, `bug`.
Provision it across all projects with
`shared-standards/scripts/sentry-github-issues.sh` (idempotent, `--dry-run` first).

Per-project activation checklist:

1. Org GitHub integration installed once in Sentry (Settings → Integrations → GitHub) with
   access to the chrysa repos.
2. The repo has a Sentry project whose slug matches the repo name.
3. The auto-issue alert rule exists (run the provisioning script, or add it in
   Alerts → Create Alert → Issues → action "Create a GitHub issue").
4. The GitHub repo has a `sentry` label (CI label sync provides it).

## Governance — strategic pillars & ADR format

Five non-negotiables hold across every chrysa project, whatever the stack. Breaking one
requires an ADR with a kill-test, not a shrug.

1. **LLM-provider independence** — no vendor SDK in business code; inference goes through a
   local port with **≥2 real, tested adapters** (e.g. Claude + a local model). A prompt that
   only works on one vendor is a bug, not a feature.
2. **GAFAM independence** — every managed-cloud dependency has a documented self-hosted exit
   path; the cloud SDK stays confined to an adapter (`BlobStore`, not `S3Client`).
3. **Portable personalisation data** — all user/personal data is exportable to an open format
   (JSON/SQLite) by a documented command; `export → import → export` is idempotent (tested).
   A stored-but-unexportable field needs an ADR.
4. **k8s config in-project** — manifests live in `deploy/k8s/` of the repo; nothing exists
   only inside a running cluster.
5. **Adaptation layer** — no third-party lib/API/service is imported by the domain directly;
   it goes through an adapter whose port is written in the domain's language, not the vendor's.

**ADR format (refutable).** Any structural decision — new external dependency, LLM/cloud
provider choice, breaking public-API change, data-model change, or a pillar exception — gets
one ADR under `docs/adr/` (series named in the local `CLAUDE.md`). Beyond the classic fields,
every chrysa ADR carries three that make it falsifiable:

- **Fatal hypothesis** — the single, falsifiable belief whose falsity invalidates the decision.
  One only; about the real world (cost, latency, a third party), not an internal intention.
- **Kill-test** — the observable, dated signal that proves it wrong: what to measure, which
  threshold, when checked, what happens on breach. Mechanised as a test where possible.
- **Validation gate** — the pre-agreed condition that unlocks the next step, written *before*
  building.

`Killed` is a valid ADR status: the kill-test fired and the hypothesis was false. A corpus with
no `Killed` entry has kill-tests that are too lax. Scaffold a new record with `/adr-new`.
